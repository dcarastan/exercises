'''
 You have a list of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.

Write a function get_products_of_all_ints_except_at_index() that takes a list of integers and returns a list of the products.

For example, given:

  [1, 7, 3, 4]

your function would return:

  [84, 12, 28, 21]

by calculating:

  [7*3*4, 1*3*4, 1*7*4, 1*7*3]

Do not use division in your solution.

    # for each integer, we find the product of all the integers
    # after it. since each index in products already has the
    # product of all the integers before it, now we're storing

int_list = [3, 1, 2, 5, 6, 4]

print "int_list = %r" % int_list

print "out_list = %r" % get_products_of_all_ints_except_at_index(int_list)


# Complexity
# O(n) time and O(n) space. We make two passes through our input a list, and the list we build always has the same length as the input list.
